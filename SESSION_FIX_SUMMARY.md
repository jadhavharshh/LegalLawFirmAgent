# Session Management Fix - Summary

## Problem
Chat was resetting after every message because the reset endpoint was being called on component re-renders.

## Solution
Instead of calling `/chat/reset` explicitly, we now use **dynamic session IDs** that change on every page reload.

## Changes Made

### Frontend (`apps/web/app/chat/page.tsx`)

```typescript
// OLD: Fixed session ID
const sessionId = "default";

// NEW: Dynamic session ID generated on page load
const [sessionId] = useState(() => 
  `session_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`
);
```

### Backend (`apps/api/main.py`)
- No changes needed! The existing session storage already supports multiple session IDs
- Each session ID gets its own isolated chat history

## How It Works

1. **Page Load (F5/Refresh):**
   - New session ID is generated: `session_1704123456_abc123`
   - Backend creates new chat history for this session
   - You get a fresh conversation âœ…

2. **Typing Messages:**
   - Same session ID is used: `session_1704123456_abc123`
   - Messages are added to the same session
   - Chat history persists âœ…

3. **React Re-renders:**
   - Same session ID is kept in React state
   - Chat history continues uninterrupted âœ…

4. **Next Page Reload:**
   - New session ID generated: `session_1704123789_xyz789`
   - Completely new conversation starts âœ…

## Testing

### Test 1: Chat Persistence
1. Open chat page
2. Send message: "Hello"
3. Get response
4. Send message: "What did I just say?"
5. **Expected:** Should remember "Hello"

### Test 2: Page Reload Reset
1. Send a few messages
2. Press F5 to reload
3. Send message: "What did we talk about?"
4. **Expected:** Should not remember previous conversation

### Test 3: React Re-render Stability
1. Send messages
2. Minimize/maximize window
3. Change browser size
4. Click around the UI
5. **Expected:** Chat history stays intact

## Debugging

Check browser console for:
```
ðŸ†” Chat session ID: session_1704123456_abc123
```

- This ID should be **the same** across multiple messages
- This ID should be **different** after page reload

## Backend Session Storage

The backend stores sessions in memory like this:
```python
chat_sessions = {
  "session_1704123456_abc123": {
    "messages": [...],
    "created_at": 1704123456
  },
  "session_1704123789_xyz789": {
    "messages": [...],
    "created_at": 1704123789
  }
}
```

Each session is completely isolated!
